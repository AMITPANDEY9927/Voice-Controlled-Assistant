# ðŸ“˜ JARVIS Voice Assistant

**JARVIS Voice Assistant** is a Python-based voice assistant powered by Flask, SpeechRecognition, and pyttsx3 libraries. It allows users to interact via voice commands to open popular websites and applications through a web interface.

This project demonstrates how voice recognition and text-to-speech functionality can be integrated into a web application for an interactive user experience.

## âœ… Features

âœ” Recognizes voice commands such as "Open YouTube", "Open calculator", etc.  
âœ” Opens websites like Google, YouTube, Amazon, and more.  
âœ” Launches applications like Notepad, Calculator, and Word.  
âœ” Provides real-time feedback in a web interface.  
âœ” Uses Python libraries for speech recognition and text-to-speech.  
âœ” Simple, extendable, and modular structure.

## ðŸ›  Libraries / Dependencies

You need the following Python libraries:

| Library            | Version   | Purpose                        |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Flask             | 2.3.2     | Web framework                   |
| Flask-Cors        | 3.0.10    | Handles cross-origin requests  |
| SpeechRecognition | 3.8.1     | Recognizes voice commands      |
| pyttsx3           | 2.90      | Converts text to speech        |
| pypiwin32         | 223       | Windows API support for TTS    |

## âœ… How to Install

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the files):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd JARVIS-Voice-Assistant
   ```

2. **Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the environment:**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required libraries using pip:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the necessary libraries mentioned in `requirements.txt` including Flask, SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, and others.

## â–¶ How to Run

1. Ensure your microphone is connected and working.

2. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5001/
   ```

4. Click **Start Listening**, and say commands like:

   - "Open YouTube"
   - "Open Google"
   - "Open calculator"

5. View the recognized commands and responses on the webpage.

## ðŸ“‚ About HTML and CSS

- The **templates/index.html** file is responsible for the web interface layout, buttons, status display, and examples of commands.
- The **static/style.css** file styles the web interface with colors, animations, and layout adjustments for better user experience.
- These files work together with Flask to provide a dynamic and interactive platform where the assistant listens for commands and displays the output in real-time.

## âš™ Notes

âœ” Works best on Windows because `pyttsx3` with `pypiwin32` is configured for it.  
âœ” Requires microphone access permissions in the browser.  
âœ” Ensure no other application is using the microphone.

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements

- Add more commands for browsing and system tasks.
- Integrate AI models for smarter responses.
- Improve speech recognition accuracy and handle errors more gracefully.
